			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>MedPacto, Inc. is a genome-based innovative drug discovery company based in South Korea that focuses on developing novel therapeutics for cancer 
			and autoimmune diseases. In 2013, MedPacto was spun off from Theragen Etex (KOSDAQ, KRX), a leading genomics company. 
			Our forefront asset, Vactosertib (TEW-7197, NOV-1301), is a potent, highly selective TGFBR1 inhibitor, which is currently in Phase Ib/II clinical trials in the US and 
			Korea (MDS, MM, gastric, pancreatic cancer). Vactosertib is well tolerated and no cardio toxicity has been observed. 
			Our compound has shown synergistic effects in combination with immune checkpoint blockades, conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 
			Additionally, MedPacto is dedicated to developing other competitive compounds to address unmet needs.</p>
