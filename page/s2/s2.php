								Vactosertib blocks the TGF-β signaling pathway by inhibiting phosphorylation of TGF-β receptor I (ALK5). Vactosertib not only inhibits cancer cell growth, stem <br />
								cancer cell induction and metastasis, but it also demonstrated synergistic effects in combination with chemotherapy 1) and showed dramatic efficacy in tumor <br />
								shrinkage when treated with an immune checkpoint blockade. <br />
								<br />
								In the 1970s, the hormone and hormone-like-growth factors were considered to be cancer-related molecules. <br />
								At that time, the sarcoma growth factor (SGF) was discovered, and the transforming activity of SGF was discovered by Anita Roberts Group at the National Institutes <br />
								of Health (NIH). They found that SGF can be classified as either TGF-α or TGF-β. TGF-β was initially researched as a wound healing factor 2), however, subsequent <br />
								research findings highlighted the significance of TGF-β’s role in cancer.   
								<br />
								TGF-β signaling can promote invasion and metastasis during the later stages of carcinoma progression. <br />
								During tumor progression, tumor cells frequently lose the growth-inhibitory response to TGF-β due to an increased expression of TGF-β in the tumor <br />
								microenvironment. Cell-autonomous TGF-β signaling can cause epithelial–mesenchymal transitions (EMT) in carcinoma cells, which increase invasion and <br />
								metastasis3).<br />
								<br />
								Due to significance of TGF-β signaling in cancer, Vactosertib has the potential to be used as an anti-cancer drug for all kinds of human tumors. <br />
								A Phase 1 clinical trial was completed in the US and Phase 2 trials are currently ongoing in the US and Korea.
