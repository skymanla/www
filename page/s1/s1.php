			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>MedPacto, Inc. is a genome-based innovative drug discovery company based in South Korea that focuses on developing novel therapeutics for cancer<br />
			and autoimmune diseases. In 2013, MedPacto was spun off from Theragen Etex (KOSDAQ, KRX), a leading genomics company.<br />
			Our forefront asset, Vactosertib (TEW-7197, NOV-1301), is a potent, highly selective TGFBR1 inhibitor, which is currently in Phase Ib/II clinical trials in the US and<br />
			Korea (MDS, MM, gastric, pancreatic cancer). Vactosertib is well tolerated and no cardio toxicity has been observed.<br />
			Our compound has shown synergistic effects in combination with immune checkpoint blockades, conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy.<br />
			Additionally, MedPacto is dedicated to developing other competitive compounds to address unmet needs.</p>
