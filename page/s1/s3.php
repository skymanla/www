					[MEDPACTO] design system is designed to have flexible elasticity to cope with the changing environment. <br />
					The following regulations vary according to their relative size, proportions, and location, and are intended to take into account the functional and visual trade-offs,<br />
					making it most obvious to maintain the standards and detailed guidelines of the design. <br />
					Since this BI is not fully applicable to all special cases, you should contact the BI lead company for any questions about how to use it or for design questions.
